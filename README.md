### [Food retail forecast and network REDE](https://github.com/Gpaiva2814/Machine-Learning-Portifolio/blob/main/Previsao_varejoREDE.ipynb)

Sales forecasting in the food retail industry is crucial for strategic planning, enabling better inventory management, resource optimization, and profit maximization. With accurate analysis and data, it is possible to anticipate seasonal demands, adjust marketing strategies, and provide a more satisfying shopping experience for customers.

 correct identification of products, even without this mandatory information. Using the template, companies can keep accurate and reliable records, avoiding potential problems arising from missing information.
